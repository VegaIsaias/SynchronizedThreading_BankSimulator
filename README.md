# Multithread-Execution
Program will  simulate  the  deposits  and  withdrawals made to a fictitious bank account (I’ll let you use my real bank account if   you promise to make only deposits! ).  In this case the deposits and withdrawals will be made by synchronized threads.  Synchronization is required for two reasons –(1) mutual  exclusion  (updates  cannot  be  lost)  and  (2) because  a  withdrawal  cannot  occur  if  the  amount  of  the  withdrawal  request  is  greater  than  the  current  balance  in  the  account.    This  means  that  access  to  the  account  (the  shared object)  must  be  synchronized.  This application requires cooperation and communication amongst the various threads (cooperating synchronized threads).  (In other words, this problem is similar to the producer/consumer problem where there is more than one producer and more  than  one  consumer  process  active  simultaneously.)    If  a  withdrawal  thread  attempts to withdraw an amount greater than the current balance in the account – then it must block itself and wait until a deposit has occurred before it can try again. This  will  require  that  the  deposit  threads  signal  all waiting withdrawal threads whenever a deposit is completed.
